			<p>
				<strong>Facebook Connect</strong> and <strong>Google Login</strong>. You

			<h4>Information From Children</h4>
			<p>
				While Quick Learner is intended for users age 13 and over, if a child
				requests access to our website we accommodate them by offering a limited
				feature set and restricted website experience that removes certain
				features. We offer this restricted experience (“Child Account”) for
				accounts of all users below the age of 13 and for some users below the
				age of 16 where applicable under local law.
			</p>
			<p>
				To create a Child Account, Quick Learner requires the user to submit a
				date of birth, username and email address. We collect a parent’s email
				address from a child under the age of consent if they attempt to
				register in order to notify the parent of their child’s use of Quick
				Learner and, where required, to seek parental consent for use of that
				data. We do not sell information from Child Accounts. We may share or
				distribute information from Child Accounts as described in this section
				and this Privacy Notice, including with parents in order to provide
				notice of use and gather parental consent, with third parties to support
				internal operations, and to provide the restricted experience on the
				Service to the Child Account.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not condition a child s participation or access to any activity on
				Quick Learner on the child providing any personally-identifying
				information or any more information than is reasonably necessary for
				that activity. We may use aggregated or de-identified information about
				children for research, analysis, marketing and other commercial
				purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong>. We use a restricted
				version of Google Analytics to limit data sharing and tracking on areas
				of our site and mobile apps that are accessed by children.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Parental Rights</strong>. Parents and legal guardians of
				children under 13 can consent to collection and use of a child s
				personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that
				information to third parties. Parents or guardians can review
				information their children under 13 have contributed to Quick Learner by
				accessing their child s account via password reset. Parents can also
				request that Quick Learner delete that information and refuse to allow
				Quick Learner to collect further information from their children by
				contacting Quick Learner at{' '}
				<a href="mailto:infot@quicklearner.com" target="email">
					support@Quick Learner.com
				</a>{' '}
				. Learn more about this in our{' '}
				<a href="#managing_your_account"> Managing your Account</a> section
				below. Quick Learner may ask additional questions or take other steps to
				verify the identity of a parent or guardian before responding to a
				request to review or delete a child s information or a request to refuse
				further collection from a child.
