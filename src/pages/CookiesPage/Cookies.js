			<h3>About Cookies And Tracking Tools</h3>
			<p>
				We collect personal information about users over time and across
				different websites when you use this website, app or service. To do
				this, we use several common tracking tools. Our vendors or third parties
				may place and use these tools on our sites or apps. In this policy “we”
				and “us” refers to Quick Learner and our affiliates. It also includes
				our vendors and third parties who place tools on our sites or apps.
			</p>
			<p>
				We use third-party service providers collect information such as your IP
				address, identifiers associated with your device, other applications on
				your device, the browsers you use to access the Service, the pages
				viewed, how much time you spend on a page or Quick Learner overall,
				links you clicked, and activity information (for example, study sessions
				you have completed) to provide site metrics and other analytics
				services. This information is used by Quick Learner and third-party
				service providers on behalf of Quick Learner to analyze and track usage
				of the Service, determine the popularity of certain content, and better
				understand how you use the Service.
			</p>
			<p>
				The tools these providers use may include browser cookies. We also use
				other technologies that function similarly to cookies. For instance, we
				may also use web beacons, flash cookies, and similar technologies. We
				also use local storage, which allows data to be stored locally on your
				browser or device and includes HTML5 local storage and browser cache.
				Our website includes social media features and widgets, such as the
				&quot;Share This&quot; button. These features may collect your IP
				address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie
				to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and
				widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our
				site. To learn more about what tracking tools are and how they work
				visit here.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can find more information about the different reasons we use cookies
				below and manage your cookies preferences using the widget included in
				&quot;Your Choices&quot;.
			</p>
			<h3>The Tracking Tools We Use</h3>
			<p>
				We use tracking tools for many reasons, including to engage in
				interest-based advertising, count visitors to a page, or enhance the
				security of our services. We have described these tools below by type.
				They are (1) essential tracking tools; (2) analytic tools; and (3)
				social media, marketing and advertising tools.
			</p>
			<h4>Essential Tracking Tools</h4>
			<p>
				These cookies are necessary for our services to function properly and to
				help identify and prevent security risks. We may also use these cookies
				to remember your settings and preferences. For example, if you study a
				Quick Learner study set in Test Mode, your preferences about how many
				and what kinds of questions appear in the test are stored in a cookie.
				When you log in to your Quick Learner account, we set an encrypted
				cookie that uniquely identifies you so that on subsequent visits to
				Quick Learner.com you automatically stay logged in. For some features of
				the website, it’s necessary to store data temporarily on one page so
				that we can use it again on another. For example, if you are referred by
				another user to Quick Learner, a referral code is stored in a cookie so
				that, if you chose to upgrade, we can credit that other user with the
				referral.
			</p>
			<h4>Analytic Tools</h4>
			<p>
				We use these cookies to collect information about how you interact with
				our services to help us improve them. We may use these cookies to
				determine if you have interacted with certain content or features. We
				use these cookies to learn more about what features are the most popular
				with our users.
			</p>
			<h4>Social Media, Marketing, and Advertising Tools</h4>
			<p>
				Social media and marketing cookies let you connect to your social
				networks and share content from our websites through social media.
				Interest-based advertising or “online behavioral advertising” is serving
				advertising content to you based on information gathered from you over
				time across multiple sites or other platforms. It includes serving ads
				to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return. It also
				includes serving ads we think are relevant based on your browsing habits
				or online activities. These ads might be served on websites or on apps.
				They might also be served in emails. We might serve these ads, or third
				parties may serve ads. They might be about our products or other
				companies’ products.
			</p>
			<h3>Interest-Based Advertising</h3>
			<p>
				We use information you make available to us when you interact with us,
				our affiliates, and other third parties to decide what content is
				relevant to you. We gather this information using the tracking tools
				described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your
				purchases or browsing behaviors. We or our partners might also look at
				your location. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the
				platforms of others.
			</p>
			<p>
				We work with third parties who help gather this information. These third
				parties might link your name or email address to other information they
				collect. That might include past purchases made online. Or, it might
				include online usage information.
			</p>
			<h3>Your Choices</h3>
			<p>
				When you visit our website for the first time, a banner may inform you
				of the use of cookies and your choices. You can also configure your
				cookies and advertising settings at any time using this widget.&nbsp;
				<strong>Choices you make are both browser and device specific.</strong>
			</p>
			<h4>How To Control Certain Tracking Tools</h4>
			<p>
				Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so
				depends on the type of cookie. You can set your browser to reject
				cookies. To find out more about how to control cookies from your web
				browser, please visit here. To control flash cookies, which we may use,
				you can go here. Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through
				your browser settings.
			</p>
			<h4>How To Control Interest-Based Advertising</h4>
			<p>
				Quick Learner and our third-party advertising partners may serve
				advertisements when you visit our website. In order to provide
				advertisements about goods and services of interest to you, Quick
				Learner and our third-party advertising partners may use information
				collected from you, or from devices associated with you (not including
				your name, address, email address or telephone number), and your visits
				to this and other websites to show you more relevant ads. The
				Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program
				provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online
				behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes. To opt out of
				having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes, click
				here. European users should use the following link to learn more about
				how to opt out of receiving these types of ads:
				https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Digital Advertising Alliance also offers a tool for opting out of
				the collection of cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based
				advertising. To exercise choice for companies participating in this
				tool, download the AppChoices app here.
			</p>
			<h3>Our Do Not Track Policy</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>
					Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a
					website not to track you. These features are not all uniform.&nbsp;
				</strong>
				We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies,
				certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject
				cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.
